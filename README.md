# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview

This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** that provides personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and viewing history. The system leverages **Collaborative Filtering** and machine learning techniques to optimize recommendations.

## Programming Paradigm

- **Declarative Programming**

## Technologies Used

- **Python** (Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow)
- **Flask** (for API development)
- **PostgreSQL** (for database management)

## Technical Requirements

1. **Collaborative Filtering Model**
   - Develop a machine learning model using **Scikit-Learn** and **TensorFlow** to recommend movies based on user interactions.
2. **API Development**
   - Implement RESTful APIs using **Flask** to handle user data, movie interactions, and recommendation requests.
3. **User Behavior Analysis**
   - Analyze user viewing patterns to improve recommendation accuracy and optimize movie suggestions.
4. **User Engagement Features**
   - Allow users to rate, comment, and share movie recommendations.

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd movie-recommendation-system
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   # Configure PostgreSQL and apply migrations
   ```
4. Run the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage

- Users can register and log in to the system.
- The system collects viewing history and user preferences.
- Movies are recommended based on Collaborative Filtering.
- Users can rate and comment on movies.
- API endpoints allow integration with external applications.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement **Content-Based Filtering** for better hybrid recommendations.
- Integrate **Deep Learning** for improved accuracy.
- Develop a **mobile-friendly UI** for better accessibility.
